CHANGE FROM PRIOR KAISER BONE MINERAL DENSITY STUDY: 
$TRENDS$
The changes reported are the apparent changes in bone mineral density (BMD) from the previous DXA scan to the current DXA scan.  Though we cannot state whether this represents a significant change between scans because the least significant change (LSC) for each specific Northwest Kaiser Permanente location cannot be calculated, CHANGES GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 5% ARE GENERALLY CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT.

$FRAX$RECOMMENDATIONS FOR WHEN TO TREAT:
The National Osteoporosis Foundation recommends that FDA- approved medical therapies be considered in postmenopausal women and men age >=50 years with a: 

*Hip or vertebral (clinical or morphometric) fracture
*T-score of <= -2.5 at the spine or hip
*T-score of -1 to -2.49 at the spine or hip and ten-year fracture probability by FRAX equal to or greater than 20% for major osteoporotic fracture or equal to or greater than 3% for hip fracture. 


All treatment decisions require clinical judgement and consideration of individual patient factors.  Refer to the KP clinical library on osteoporosis for further information.

RESULTS:

Tallest height patient has ever been (patient reported): $REPORTED_MAX_HEIGHT$
$HEIGHT_ON_PRIOR$Current height: $CURRENT_HEIGHT$

$MEASUREMENTS$
High bone mass = T-score > + 2 
Normal bone mass = T-score -1 to + 2
Low normal bone mass = T-score <-1 to -2
Low bone mass = T-score <-2 to -2.49
Osteoporosis = T-score <or = -2.5

$TREND_SECTION$$OUTSIDE_DISCLAIMER$GUIDELINES FOR WHEN TO REPEAT BONE DENSITY:
For women over 65 years and men over 70 who are NOT receiving prescription osteoporosis medications, rescreening interval is determined by T-score: 

* Equal to or greater than -1.4: 10 years
*-1.5 to -1.9: 5 years
*-2.0 to -2.4:2 years


CONSIDERATION FOR FURTHER IMAGING:
Per ISCD recommendations, indications for vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) with lateral thoracic and lumbar spine x-rays are a T-score between -1 to -2.49 if female patient has historical height loss of  > 4cm (1.6 inches) or a male patient has a historical height loss of >6cm (2.4 inches), and if documentation of a vertebral fracture will alter clinical management.
