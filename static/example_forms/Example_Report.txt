Date of Exam: 2025-06-20
Time of Exam: 10:51:01

Comparison:    

Clinical Concern: Bone Mineral Density

DIAGNOSIS:    

Quality of scan:    


Prognosticated Fracture Risk (FRAX):

Pertinent risk factors:



History of Fracture (Adult)


10 Year Fracture Probability
Major osteoporotic fracture:    
Hip fracture:    


RECOMMENDATIONS FOR WHEN TO TREAT:
The National Osteoporosis Foundation recommends that FDA- approved medical therapies be considered in postmenopausal women and men age >=50 years with a: 

*Hip or vertebral (clinical or morphometric) fracture
*T-score of <= -2.5 at the spine or hip
*T-score of -1 to -2.49 at the spine or hip and ten-year fracture probability by FRAX equal to or greater than 20% for major osteoporotic fracture or equal to or greater than 3% for hip fracture. 


All treatment decisions require clinical judgement and consideration of individual patient factors.  Refer to the KP clinical library on osteoporosis for further information.

CHANGE FROM PRIOR KAISER BONE MINERAL DENSITY STUDY: 
Spine:     ,     change
Left Hip:    ,     change
Right Hip:    ,     change
Radius:    ,     change

The changes reported are the apparent changes in bone mineral density (BMD) from the previous DXA scan to the current DXA scan.  Though we cannot state whether this represents a significant change between scans because the least significant change (LSC) for each specific Northwest Kaiser Permanente location cannot be calculated, CHANGES GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 5% ARE GENERALLY CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT.

Disclaimer: Quantitative comparison with scans from an outside institution, including Oregon Osteoporosis Center, cannot be made due to statistical variations among testing locations.

GUIDELINES FOR WHEN TO REPEAT BONE DENSITY:
For women over 65 years and men over 70 who are NOT receiving prescription osteoporosis medications, rescreening interval is determined by T-score: 

* Equal to or greater than -1.4: 10 years
*-1.5 to -1.9: 5 years
*-2.0 to -2.4:2 years


CONSIDERATION FOR FURTHER IMAGING:
Per ISCD recommendations, indications for vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) with lateral thoracic and lumbar spine x-rays are a T-score between -1 to -2.49 if female patient has historical height loss of  > 4cm (1.6 inches) or a male patient has a historical height loss of >6cm (2.4 inches), and if documentation of a vertebral fracture will alter clinical management.
